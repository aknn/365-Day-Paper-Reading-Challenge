* To readers
You could fork this repo and start your own 365-day challenge on your branch. Let's study together!

* Schedule
I will read an article related to deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and/or software engineering every day. This paper reading is more about a breadth reading. I do not want all my reading is limited to my research project. I hope I could keep pace with the latest research in AI/ML/DL/SE. So, in that case, the paper reading will be in *coarse-grained* manner.

I will try to summarize the key idea of the paper. Currently, I want my daily notes to follow the structure:
1. Problem
2. Method
3. Result
4. Future work

I hope I could keep it work up and improve my ability to read and write.
